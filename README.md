The Nova Reactor
===========================

The Nova Reactor is the [website](http://nova-reactor.com) of a code analysis tool that profiles the code generated by the Nova compiler with the use of instrumentation.

The advantage of the profiling with the Nova-Reactor is that the profiling is done on various languages, as shown in this beautifully illustrated image:

This multilingual approach to profiling offers the following advantages:

  * Performance verification.
  * More in-depth performance optimizations.
  * Objective algorithmic performance.

The [Nova Reactor Core](https://github.com/NovaFoundation/Nova-Reactor-Core) is where the analysis occurs.
